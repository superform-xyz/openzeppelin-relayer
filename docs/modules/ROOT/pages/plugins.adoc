:description: User guide for setting up and configuring OpenZeppelin Relayer Plugins.

== Overview

OpenZeppelin Relayer supports plugins to extend the functionality of the relayer.

Plugins are `TypeScript` functions running in the Relayer server that can include any arbitrary logic defined by the Relayer operator.

It also includes a simple `PluginAPI` library to interact with the Relayer, allowing to send transactions, and
is extensible to support new features in the future.

== Configuration

=== Writing a Plugin

Plugins are declared under `plugins` directory, and are expected to be TypeScript files (`.ts` extension).

[source,bash]
----
openzeppelin-relayer/
├── plugins/
│   └── my-plugin.ts    # Plugin code
└── config/
    └── config.json     # Plugins in configuration file
----

The plugin code must include the following structure:

[source,typescript]
----
/// Required imports.
import { runPlugin, PluginAPI } from "./lib/plugin";

/// Additional imports.
import { ethers } from "ethers";

/// Here you can define custom params that will be included as part
/// of the request when the plugin is invoked.
type MyCustomParams = {
  foo: string,
  bar: number
}

/// The plugin function body.
async function myPlugin(api: PluginAPI, params: MyCustomParams) {
    // You can use the `params` to access the custom params passed to the plugin.
    console.log(params.foo);
    console.log(params.bar);

    // Api usage to send a transaction:
    let relayer = api.relayer('my-relayer');
    const tx = await relayer.sendTransaction({
        to: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
        value: ethers.parseEther("1"),
    });
}

/// `runPlugin` is the entry point for the plugin.
runPlugin(myPlugin);
----

=== Declaring in config file

Plugins are configured in the `./config/config.json` file, under the `plugins` key.

The file contains a list of plugins, each with an id and path.

NOTE: The plugin path is relative to the `/plugins` directory

Example:

[source,json]
----

"plugins": [
  {
    "id": "my-plugin",
    "path": "my-plugin.ts"
  }
]
----

== Invocation

Plugins are invoked by hitting the `api/v1/plugins/{plugin-id}/call` endpoint.

The endpoint accepts a `POST` request with the following body:

[source,json]
----
{
  "params": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "bar": 1
  }
}
----

Then the plugin will be invoked passing the `params` as the second argument of the plugin function.

== Debugging

When invoking a plugin, the response will include:

- `logs`: The logs from the plugin execution.
- `return_value`: The returned value of the plugin execution.
- `error`: An error message if the plugin execution failed.
- `traces`: A list of messages sent between the plugin and the Relayer instance. This includes all the payloads passed through the `PluginAPI` object.

=== Example

1. Example Plugin code:

[source,typescript]
----
import { runPlugin, Plugin } from "./lib/plugin";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

type MyCustomParams = {
  foo: string,
}

async function myPlugin(api: Plugin, params: MyCustomParams) {
    console.log("Hello, world!");

    // For example, to send a transaction:
    let relayer = api.relayer('my-relayer');
    const tx = await relayer.sendTransaction({
        to: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
        value: ethers.parseEther("1"),
    });

    console.log("Foo ", params.foo);

    return `Successfully sent transaction with id: ${tx.id}`;
}

runPlugin(myPlugin);
----

2. Example Invocation:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/plugins/my-plugin/call \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"params": {"foo": "bar"}}'
----

3. Example Response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Plugin called successfully",
  "logs": [
    {
      "level": "log",
      "message": "Hello, world!"
    },
    {
      "level": "log",
      "message": "Foo bar"
    }
  ],
  "return_value": "Successfully sent transaction with id: 1234567890",
  "error": "",
  "traces": [
    {
      "relayer_id": "my-relayer",
      "method": "sendTransaction",
      "payload": {
        "to": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
        "value": "1000000000000000000"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Where:
- `logs` indicates the terminal logs (console.log, console.error, etc.) of the plugin.
- `traces` are the messages sent between the plugin and the Relayer instance.
- `error` will include the error message if the plugin fails.
- `return_value` will include the returned value of the plugin execution.
