= Signers Configuration
:description: Configuration guide for transaction signers in OpenZeppelin Relayer.

== Overview

Signers are responsible for cryptographically signing transactions before they are submitted to blockchain networks. OpenZeppelin Relayer supports multiple signer types to accommodate different security requirements and infrastructure setups.

The `signers` array in your configuration must contain at least one valid signer configuration. Each signer is referenced by its `id` in relayer configurations.

== Configuration Structure

Example signer configuration:
[source,json]
----
"signers": [
  {
    "id": "my_id",
    "type": "local",
    "config": {
      "path": "config/keys/local-signer.json",
      "passphrase": {
        "type": "env",
        "value": "KEYSTORE_PASSPHRASE"
      }
    }
  }
]
----

== Supported Signer Types

OpenZeppelin Relayer supports the following signer types:

- `local`: Keystore file signer
- `vault`: HashiCorp Vault secret signer
- `vault_cloud`: Hosted HashiCorp Vault secret signer
- `vault_transit`: HashiCorp Vault Transit signer
- `turnkey`: Turnkey signer
- `google_cloud_kms`: Google Cloud KMS signer
- `aws_kms`: Amazon AWS KMS signer

== Network Compatibility Matrix

The following table shows which signer types are compatible with each network type:

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
|===
|Signer Type |EVM Networks |Solana Networks |Stellar Networks

|`local`
|✅ Supported
|✅ Supported
|✅ Supported

|`vault`
|✅ Supported

|❌ Not supported

|`vault_cloud`

|===

[NOTE]
====
**Network-specific considerations:**

- **EVM Networks**: Use secp256k1 cryptography. Most signers support EVM networks with proper key generation.
- **Solana Networks**: Use ed25519 cryptography. Ensure your signer supports ed25519 key generation and signing.
- **Stellar Networks**: Use ed25519 cryptography with specific Stellar requirements. Limited signer support due to network-specific implementation requirements.
- **AWS KMS**: Currently optimized for EVM networks with secp256k1 support.
- **Google Cloud KMS**: Supports both secp256k1 (EVM) and ed25519 (Solana) key types.
- **Turnkey**: Supports EVM and Solana networks with appropriate key management.

== Security Best Practices

=== File Permissions
- Set restrictive permissions on keystore files: `chmod 0500 config/keys/*`
- Ensure configuration directories are properly secured
- Use environment variables for sensitive data like passphrases and API keys

=== Key Management
- Use HSM-backed keys for production environments when available
- Implement proper key rotation policies
- Never commit private keys or sensitive configuration to version control
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions

=== Environment Separation
- Use different signers for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Implement proper secrets management in production deployments
- Consider using cloud-native key management services for enhanced security

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Invalid keystore passphrase**

- Verify the passphrase environment variable is correctly set
- Check that the keystore file is not corrupted
- Ensure the keystore format is compatible

**Cloud KMS authentication failures**

- Verify service account credentials are valid and properly formatted
- Check that the service account has necessary permissions for KMS operations
- Ensure the KMS key exists and is in the correct region/project

**Vault connection issues**

- Verify Vault server address and network connectivity
- Check AppRole credentials and permissions
- Ensure the secret/transit engine is properly mounted and configured

For additional troubleshooting help, check the application logs and refer to the specific cloud provider or service documentation.
