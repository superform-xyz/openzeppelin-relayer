:description: Configuration guide for OpenZeppelin Relayer.

== Overview

Most configuration files should live under `./config`, including the signer configurations, under `./config/keys`.
Please ensure appropriate access permissions on all configuration files (for `./config/keys/*`, we recommend `0500`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The OpenZeppelin Relayer supports two configuration approaches:

**File-based Configuration:**
1. **`config.json`**: Contains relayer definitions, signer configurations, and network policies
2. **`.env`** file: Contains environment variables like API keys and connection strings

**API-based Configuration:**
- Full CRUD operations for relayers, signers, and notifications via REST API
- Changes take effect immediately (no container restart required)
- See the **API Reference** page for detailed endpoints documentation

See xref:storage.adoc[Storage Configuration] for detailed information about how file-based and API-based configurations work together, storage behavior, and best practices.

For quick setup examples with pre-configured files, see the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-relayer/tree/main/examples[examples directory] in our GitHub repository.
====

== Main configuration file (config.json)

This file can exist in any directory, but the default location is `./config/config.json`.

[NOTE]
====
All components defined in `config.json` can also be managed via REST API endpoints. This provides runtime flexibility for adding, updating, or removing relayers, signers, and notifications without restarting the service. See the **API Reference** page for detailed endpoints documentation.
====

Key sections in this file include:

- Signers: Defines transaction signing methods.
- Notifications: Sets up status alerts
- Relayers: Configures networks, notifications channels, policies & singers.
- Networks: Defines blockchain network configurations.
- Plugins: Configures plugins.

=== 1. Signers

Transaction signers are responsible for cryptographically signing transactions before they are submitted to blockchain networks.

For comprehensive details on configuring all supported signer types including:

- Local keystore file signers
- HashiCorp Vault (secret and transit)
- Cloud KMS providers (Google Cloud, AWS)
- Turnkey signers
- Security best practices and troubleshooting

See the dedicated xref:signers.adoc[Signers Configuration] guide.

[TIP]
====
Signers can also be managed via API endpoints.

See the **API Reference** page for detailed endpoints documentation.

|===
|Network type |Policy |Type |Description

|solana, evm
|min_balance
|unsigned 128
|Minimum balance (in lamports or wei) required for the relayer to operate. Optional.

|solana
|fee_payment_strategy
|enum(user,relayer)
|Specifies who pays the fee. "user" (default) means the sender pays; "relayer" means the relayer pays. For "user", RPC methods add an instruction to transfer SPL tokens (calculated from the current SOL price plus a configurable margin) from the user to the relayer, ensuring fees are sustainably covered in tokens rather than SOL.

|solana
|swap_config
|SwapConfig
|Optional object configuring automated token‐swaps on Solana.

|solana
|fee_margin_percentage
|f32
|Additional margin percentage added to estimated transaction fees to account for price fluctuations. For example, a value of 10 will add 10% to estimated fees. Optional.

|solana
|max_allowed_fee_lamports
|unsigned 64
|Maximum allowed fee (in lamports) for a transaction. Optional.

|solana
|allowed_tokens
|Vector<AllowedToken>

|allowed_accounts
|Vector<String>
|List of allowed accounts by their public keys. The relayer will only operate with these accounts if provided.

|solana

|Vector<String>
|List of disallowed accounts by their public keys. These accounts will be explicitly blocked.

|solana
|max_tx_data_size
|unsigned 16

|solana
|max_signatures
|unsigned 8
|Maximum supported signatures. Optional.

|evm

|evm
|whitelist_receivers
|Vector<String>
|A list of authorized contracts for each transaction sent using the Relayer. Transactions will be rejected if the destination address is not on the list. (Optional)
|===

==== RPC URL Configuration

The relayer supports two ways to configure RPC URLs:

1. **Public RPC URLs**: These are the default RPC endpoints provided by the network. They are automatically selected based on the network configuration.

2. **Custom RPC URLs**: You can specify custom RPC URLs using the `custom_rpc_urls` field in the relayer configuration. Each URL can be configured with an optional weight for high availability:

[source,json]
----
"custom_rpc_urls": [
  {
    "url": "https://primary-rpc.example.com",
    "weight": 2  // Higher weight routes more requests to this endpoint. The value must be an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
  },
  {
    "url": "https://secondary-rpc.example.com",
    "weight": 100, // Max allowed weight
  },
  {
    "url": "https://backup-rpc.example.com"  // No weight specified, defaults to 100
  },
  {
    "url": "https://backup2-rpc.example.com",
    "weight": 0, //  A value of 0 disables the endpoint.
  }
]
----

This is useful when you want to:
   * Use your own RPC nodes with load balancing
   * Use a paid service provider for better reliability and performance
   * Override the default public RPC URLs
   * Access custom network endpoints
   * Configure primary and backup endpoints with different weights

When both are available, the relayer will:
1. First attempt to use the `custom_rpc_urls` if configured.
2. Fall back to the public RPC URLs if no custom URL is configured.

For backward compatibility, string arrays are still supported:

[source,json]
----
"custom_rpc_urls": ["https://your-rpc.example.com"]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using custom RPC URLs:

* Ensure the URLs are secure (HTTPS) when accessing over public networks
* Keep your API keys and authentication tokens secure
* Test the RPC endpoints' reliability and performance before using it in production
* Configure weights to prioritize endpoints, assigning higher values to more reliable or performant ones.
* The weight must be an integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
* A weight of 0 disables the endpoint.
* If a weight is not specified for an endpoint, it defaults to 100.
====

[TIP]
====
Relayers could also be managed via API endpoints.

See the **API Reference** page for detailed endpoints documentation.
====


=== 4. Plugins

For more information on how to write a plugin, please refer to the xref:plugins.adoc[Plugins] page.

* `plugins` array, containing plugin configurations:

[source,json]
----
"plugins": [
  {
    "id": "my-plugin",
    "path": "my-plugin.ts"
  }
]
----

Available configuration fields
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Field |Type |Description

|id
|String
|Unique id for the plugin

|path
|String
|Path to the plugin file
|===


=== 5. Networks

You can configure networks either:

- In separate JSON files (recommended for better organization)
- Directly in your main `config.json`

For comprehensive network configuration details, including:

- Network field reference
- Configuration examples for all network types
- Network inheritance
- Special tags and their behavior
- Best practices and troubleshooting


See the dedicated xref:network_configuration.adoc[Network Configuration] guide.

== Configuration Management Approaches

The OpenZeppelin Relayer supports two complementary approaches for configuration management:

=== File-based Configuration
- Ideal for initial setup and deployment
- Configuration persists across restarts
- Requires container restart for changes to take effect
- Suitable for infrastructure-as-code workflows

=== API-based Configuration
- Enables runtime configuration changes
- No service restarts required
- Perfect for dynamic environments
- Supports automated configuration management

[NOTE]
====
See xref:storage.adoc[Storage Configuration] for detailed information about how file-based and API-based configurations work together, storage behavior, and best practices.
