:description: User guide for setting up and configuring OpenZeppelin Relayer.

== Overview

CAUTION: This software is in alpha stage. Use in production environments at your own risk.

OpenZeppelin Relayer is a service that provides infrastructure to relay transactions to the EVM & Non-EVM networks. It is designed to be used as a backend for dApps that need to interact with these networks.


== Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Interact with multiple blockchain networks, including Solana and EVM-based chains.
- **Transaction Relaying**: Submit transactions to supported blockchain networks efficiently.
- **Transaction Signing**: Securely sign transactions using configurable key management.
- **Transaction Fee Estimation**: Estimate transaction fees for better cost management.
- **Solana Gasless Transactions**: Support for gasless transactions on Solana, enabling users to interact without transaction fees.
- **Transaction Nonce Management**: Handle nonce management to ensure transaction order.
- **Transaction Status Monitoring**: Track the status of submitted transactions.
- **SDK Integration**: Easily interact with the relayer through our companion JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add support for new blockchain networks.
- **Configurable Network Policies**: Define and enforce network-specific policies for transaction processing.
- **Metrics and Observability**: Monitor application performance using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Docker Support**: Deploy the relayer using Docker for both development and production environments.
- **Plugins**: Extend the functionality of the relayer with custom logic using TypeScript functions.


== Supported Networks

OpenZeppelin Relayer supports multiple blockchain networks through a flexible JSON-based configuration system. Networks are defined in configuration files, allowing you to configure:

- **Any EVM-compatible network** (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.)
- **Solana networks** (mainnet-beta, devnet, testnet, custom RPC endpoints)
- **Stellar networks** (Pubnet, Testnet, custom networks)
- **Create custom network configurations** with specific RPC endpoints, chain IDs, and network parameters
- **Use inheritance** to create network variants that inherit from base configurations

=== Network Types

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Network Type |Description

|`evm`
|Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible networks. Supports any EVM chain by configuring chain ID, RPC URLs, and network-specific parameters.

|`solana`
|Solana blockchain networks. Supports all Solana clusters and custom RPC endpoints.

|`stellar`
|Stellar blockchain networks (Partial support). Supports Stellar Public Network and Testnet.
|===

Networks can be loaded from:

- **JSON arrays**: Direct network definitions in configuration files
- **Directory of files**: Multiple JSON files each containing network definitions

For detailed network configuration options and examples, see the xref:network_configuration.adoc[Network Configuration] page.

====

=== Install Locally

. Clone the repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/openzeppelin/openzeppelin-relayer
cd openzeppelin-relayer
----

. Verify you have sodium libs installed. If not, follow these instructions:
+
* Install a stable libsodium version from link:https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/[here].
* Follow the steps in the link:https://doc.libsodium.org/installation[libsodium installation guide].

. Install dependencies:
+
[source,bash]
----
cargo build
----

== Running the Relayer

=== Option 1: Run Locally


[source,bash]
----
cargo run
----

NOTE: Before executing the command, ensure that the `.env` and `config.json` files are configured as detailed in the xref:index.adoc#configuration_references[Configuration References] section.

=== Option 2: Run with Docker

The Relayer can be run as either a development or production container using the corresponding Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.development` or `Dockerfile.production`).

==== Step 1: Configure Environment

* Edit `.env` at the root of the repository to adjust environment variables
* The appropriate .env file will be included during image build

==== Step 2: Build the Image

You can build using Docker Compose (v2).

[source,bash]
----
# Default build
docker compose build

# Or, for a leaner image (and using Dockerfile.production)
DOCKERFILE=Dockerfile.production docker compose build
----

==== Step 3: Run the Container

Use Docker Compose to run the container:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

For production runs, you can use:

[source,bash]
----
DOCKERFILE=Dockerfile.production docker compose up -d
----

== Configuration

OpenZeppelin Relayer requires proper configuration before starting. The configuration system uses two main files:

- **`config.json`**: Contains relayer definitions, signer configurations, and network policies
- **`.env`**: Contains environment variables like API keys and connection strings

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both configuration files must be properly set up before starting the application. Changes to either file require restarting the container to take effect.

For quick setup examples with pre-configured files, see the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-relayer/tree/main/examples[examples directory] in our GitHub repository.
====

For comprehensive configuration details, including:

- Environment variables and their settings
- Main configuration file structure
- Signer configurations (local, vault, cloud KMS, etc.)
- Notification setup
- Relayer policies and network settings
- Plugin configuration
- Complete configuration examples

See the dedicated xref:configuration.adoc[Configuration Guide].

== Important Considerations

CAUTION: This software is in alpha stage. Use in production environments at your own risk.

== Deployment Considerations

NOTE: The OpenZeppelin Relayer is designed to function as a backend service and is not meant to be directly exposed to the public internet. To protect the service from unauthorized access, deploy it behind your own secure backend infrastructure—such as a reverse proxy or firewall—and restrict access to trusted internal components only. Direct exposure can increase the risk of exploitation and security breaches.
