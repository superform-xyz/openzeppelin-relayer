== General Roadmap

* *Stability Improvements*
** Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms: Implement robust exception management and failover processes to minimize downtime.
** Improved background job processing: Optimize task scheduling and queuing systems to ensure smooth and reliable asynchronous operations.
** Comprehensive test coverage: Extend unit, integration, and regression tests across all components.
** End-to-End (E2E) testing: Simulate real-world scenarios to verify complete system functionality.
** Performance optimizations: Enhance throughput and reduce latency for high-demand scenarios.
** Stress and load testing: Identify and address performance bottlenecks under extreme conditions.

* *Security Enhancements*
** External security audit: Engage third-party experts to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
** Continuous security monitoring: Implement ongoing surveillance and incident response protocols to swiftly address threats.

* *Developer Experience*
** SDK improvements: Expand SDK capabilities, add multi-language support, and simplify integration processes.
** Enhanced documentation: Develop interactive guides, detailed API references, and comprehensive troubleshooting tips.
** Additional examples and best practices: Provide real-world usage scenarios and community-contributed tutorials to ease onboarding.

* *Features*
** Redis storage integration: Leverage Redis for fast, scalable data storage across all system components.
** Enhanced relayer balance management: Implement real-time monitoring and alerts to maintain optimal balance status.
** Dynamic gas price updates: Regularly fetch and update gas prices from multiple reliable sources to ensure accurate fee estimations.

* *Scaling Improvements*
** Horizontal scaling capabilities: Design the system architecture to seamlessly distribute workloads across multiple instances.
