/// This module provides utility functions and structures for managing and interacting
/// with relayers within the application. It includes functions to retrieve relayers
/// by ID, construct network relayers, and handle unsupported operations for specific
/// relayer types.
///
/// The primary components of this module are:
/// - `get_relayer_by_id`: Retrieves a relayer from the repository using its ID.
/// - `get_network_relayer`: Constructs a network relayer using a relayer ID.
/// - `get_network_relayer_by_model`: Constructs a network relayer using a relayer model.
/// - `solana_not_supported`: Returns an error for unsupported Solana relayer operations.
///
/// These utilities are essential for the application's relayer management and
/// interaction with the underlying repositories and factories.
